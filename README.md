# SubNFTx: Tokenized Subscription Framework

## Overview
This PR introduces a secure and scalable smart contract implementation for managing subscription-based access using NFTs on the Stacks blockchain. The contract enables content creators to offer tiered subscription services with time-based access control and NFT-based verification.

## Key Features
- **Tiered Subscription System**
  - Pre-configured Bronze, Silver, and Gold tiers
  - Customizable duration and pricing per tier
  - Time-based access control using block height
  
- **NFT-Based Access Control**
  - SIP-009 compliant NFT implementation
  - Automatic NFT minting on subscription
  - Secure transfer and ownership tracking
  - NFT-verified content access

- **Content Management**
  - Granular content access rights per tier
  - Content metadata storage
  - Minimum tier requirements for content access

- **Security Enhancements**
  - Robust input validation for all public functions
  - Principal address validation
  - Comprehensive error handling
  - Protection against unauthorized access
  - Strict tier ID limitations

## Technical Implementation Details
- Implemented SIP-009 NFT trait with required functions
- Added validation functions for all user inputs
- Integrated time-based subscription management
- Implemented content access verification system
- Added administrative functions for contract management

## Security Considerations
- All compiler warnings addressed through input validation
- Protected functions with appropriate authorization checks
- Implemented safeguards against common attack vectors
- Added bounds checking for numerical inputs
- Validated principal addresses before operations

## Testing
The contract has been tested for:
- Subscription creation and management
- NFT minting and transfer operations
- Content access verification
- Input validation and error handling
- Administrative functions

## Code Quality
- No compiler warnings
- Clear function documentation
- Consistent error handling
- Modular design for extensibility
- Clear separation of concerns

## Usage Example

;; Subscribe to Bronze tier
(contract-call? .subnftx subscribe u1)

;; Check content access
(contract-call? .subnftx can-access-content tx-sender u1)
